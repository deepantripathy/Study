What is ML ?
ML uses statisticalk techniques giving programs ability to learn from the data without giving being explicitly programmed.
In ML program, input is Data and Output and output is a Program that will predict output.

Scenarios:
a. Email spam classifier.
b. Data mining

AI vs ML vs DL

Types of ML:
a. Supervised - Redression and Classification
b. Unsupervised - Clustering, Anamoly detection, Association, Dimesnsionality reduction 
c. Semi supervised
d. Reinforcement learning

Types of ML that's influenced in production system:
a. Batch Machine Learning: The entire dataset is used for taining instead of lots. This is costly and time taking hence it's done offline system, then model is deployed on production to save costs.
Problems: 
Changing data so model can not evolve as data changes.
Hardware limitation.
Availability

b. Online Machine Learning: Performance of model improves as the product is used, so the model is trained as it gets data. Data is fed to the model in lots/batches. Since these batches are quite small the model training happens on the server. Eg. chatbots, chatgpt, keyboards on phones like swiftkey, youtube etc.
Advantages:
a. Can be used where context changes 
b. cost effective
c. faster solution

Learning rate: how frequently the model needs to train. Basically fast training rate can forget the old data and slow training is bad too. 

Problems:
a. Tricky to use as there are so many factors and variables.
b. Risky
